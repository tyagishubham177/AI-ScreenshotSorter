{"Screenshot (1).png": "You've shared a screenshot of a web application interface, likely a section of an investment platform or financial dashboard. The webpage is displaying information about ongoing IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), which is when a company first offers shares of its stock to the public on a securities exchange.\n\nThe screen is showing a table with several columns that include:\n\n- IPO Name: The name of the IPO.\n- Start Date: The date when the IPO starts.\n- End Date: The date when the IPO ends.\n- Price range: The range of the price per share for the IPO.\n- Minimum qty: The minimum quantity of shares an investor can bid for.\n\nEach IPO entry has buttons or links for actions like \"Apply\" and \"Details\", allowing users to apply for the IPO or get more details about it. Some rows denote the 'Status' as 'Oversubscribed', while others show 'request pending' or have a 'Modify bid' option, which suggests that the platform allows for various stages of interaction with different IPOs.\n\nThe top of the screen has menu options typical for an online service, including tabs like 'Dashboard', 'Portfolio', 'Reports', 'Support', and 'Account'. There's also a user icon indicating the possibility of accessing user profile settings or similar functionalities.\n\nThis screenshot does not contain any sensitive information such as personal data, names, account numbers, or balances, and is a generic representation of a financial service platform.", "Screenshot (10).png": "In the image, you can see a person who is engaged in what appears to be a live online presentation or video conference. The person is wearing glasses and a pinkish shirt and is positioned on the right side of the screen with a virtual background featuring a brick wall pattern and logos, suggesting a professional or academic setting.\n\nOn the left side of the screen, there is a slide being presented with various elements, including text boxes and arrows that indicate a flow or progression. This slide seems to be explaining some kind of process, model, or ranking, given the numbered steps and descriptive headings. It is common to use such visual aids in educational or business presentations to convey information clearly and logically.\n\nThe logos and term \"EQUIS\" displayed in the virtual background suggest this might be related to a business school or institution that has received EQUIS accreditation, which is a quality improvement system aimed at business schools and faculties around the world administered by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD). This setting underscores the possibility of the person conducting a presentation in an academic or professional development context.", "Screenshot (11).png": "In the image, we see a person, likely conducting a presentation or a webinar, as evidenced by the headset he's wearing and the presentation on the screen. The presentation includes information about international rankings of certain institutions or programs, with lists of rankings and numbers that denote their respective standings. It looks professionally organized, indicating that it's a formal or educational setting, perhaps related to business schools, as the phrase \"Leading B-Schools\" suggests. Without more context, I cannot provide specifics about the content or the person depicted.", "Screenshot (12).png": "In the image, you see a person likely presenting a slide in a virtual meeting or webinar. The slide is titled \"Programme Highlights\" and outlines various aspects of an educational or training program. Specifically, the slide mentions:\n\n- An exclusive program limited to 75 students\n- 5 terms, 75 contact hours (15 per term, 60 mins)\n- 13 Core Courses (Term 1&2); a minimum of 11 electives\n- Choice of electives from 3 to 5 days across PGP terms\n- International immersion (Term 4)\n- Gitaam University Partnerships\n- Comprehensive Transitioning to Business Project\n\nThe presentation seems to be structured to inform participants about the structure, components, and unique selling points of the program being discussed. The person in the image appears to be conducting the session, possibly as an instructor, facilitator, or representative of the program. The surroundings look like a typical office or home setup for a remote presentation or class.", "Screenshot (13).png": "This is a screenshot from a presentation, where a person is presenting a slide that displays the structure of a course or academic program. The slide appears to be divided into two main parts: \"Course Structure\" and \"Term Details.\"\n\nOn the left side under \"Course Structure,\" the information is organized by months, starting from April 5, 2021, to March 25, 2022. This part probably outlines the timeline of the course, including the various segments or terms in which the program is divided.\n\nOn the right side under \"Term Details,\" the segments are listed as Term 1, Term 2, Term 3, Term 4, Term 5, and Electives. This could imply that the program is broken down into five distinct terms with an additional period for elective subjects.\n\nThe term \"Electives\" usually refers to courses that students can choose based on their interests, as opposed to \"Core courses,\" which are probably mandatory for all students.\n\nBelow the Course Structure, there are additional events marked, such as \"Elective terms,\" \"Term break,\" and \"International Immersion (10 days).\" This suggests that the program may include an elective period, scheduled breaks, and an international immersion program where students might have an opportunity to travel abroad or engage in an intensive learning experience for ten days.\n\nThe slide also shows the label \"Term 2,\" \"Term3,\" \"Final Placements,\" and \"Convocation,\" implying these events make up the last segments", "Screenshot (14).png": "This image appears to show a presentation slide with statistical data on it, and there's a person, probably the presenter, in a smaller frame in the corner of the screen\u2014this suggests it might be from an online meeting or webinar. The slide presents data on a 'Class Profile' across three academic years: 2021-2022, 2020-2021, and 2019-2020.\n\nThe categories presented are:\n\n- Average Age\n- Class Median Work Experience\n- GMAT Range\n- Percentage of Women\n- Percentage of International Students with experience\n\nEach of these categories shows the respective numerical or range values for each academic year. For instance, the average age of 2021-2022 is listed as 75, which seems like an error since this would be an unusually high average age for a typical student class; it could be a typo or an error on the slide. The same goes for other years where the average age is listed as 73 and 76 which is more likely to be a percentile or other statistic than the actual average age.\n\nThe values for work experience appear to be in years, and those for the GMAT score are shown as a range. The percentage of women and international students with experience for each year is also listed. Without context, it's difficult to specify the nature of the class these statistics refer to - it could be a business school class profile since GMAT scores are included, which is a common admissions test for graduate", "Screenshot (15).png": "In the image, you can see a person giving a presentation, likely through a video conferencing platform. On the right side of the image, there's a slide displayed that points out some \"Admission Highlights\".

The slide includes items like eligibility criteria, application rounds, and the components of the application like the Statement of Purpose, Letters of Reference, and the Personal Interview process. It also mentions a GMAT/GRE waiver policy and a requirement of 5 years of work experience.\n\nThe person giving the presentation seems engaged in explaining the content shown on the slide. Behind the person is a backdrop with what looks like academic or institutional logos, which suggests that the person is officially representing the institution or program. The environment appears to be professional and educational.", "Screenshot (16).png": "The image shows a person presenting some information related to \"Admission Timelines.\" The person seems to be conducting an online presentation or webinar, as evidenced by the \"Recording\" label at the top, and appears to be using a virtual background featuring the logo of what looks like a university or educational institution.\n\nThe slide on screen divides the admission timelines into three rounds, each with its own set of dates for application deadlines, interviews, offers of admission, and offer acceptance deadlines. Unfortunately, due to the image's resolution and the angle, the specific dates are not entirely clear, but this structure indicates a phased admission process where applicants can choose to apply in one of several rounds, each with its own schedule.", "Screenshot (17).png": "You've shared an image that looks like a screenshot from a video presentation. The person in the image is giving a presentation about expenses, specifically regarding an \"EPGP Fees 2021-22 (INR)\" table.
